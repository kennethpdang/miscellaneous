# Kenneth's Node JS Project
The following code provided is to create a Node JS Project by following the tutorial from Shawn on the Popular Youtube Page The Net Ninja. This is a Node JS Project that uses Node JS as middleware, MongoDB as the backend, and Express JS to create templates.

## Running Files Specific to this Project
Because the following contents of this project are nested within a repo for **all** miscellaneous projects, when you need to run a node.js file, you must navigate to the appropriate directory. On your computer you would run:
```bash
> cd "Node JS Project"
```
From the folder for all miscallenous projects (which you must be in to push to this repository).
