# Kenneth's Miscellaneous Projects
This is for any tutorial related projects, and projects that have no real world use besides learning. One of the intentions behind this repository is to display knowledge of particular concepts. But you also might use it to use it to build apps that are useful but can not be used industrially (e.g.) your image recognition app vs. AWS rekognition. For sake of organization, all of the pinned LinkedIn projects will have real world applications besides those projects listed in this repository.
